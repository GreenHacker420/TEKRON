      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>This round will test the team's coding, debugging, and problem-solving skills while requiring them to complete miscellaneous tasks to gather hints. Teams will be sorted into different “Hogwarts Houses”, and each house will receive a unique set of puzzle questions. Teams will use the “Marauder's Map” to locate specific destinations based on the hints they uncover.  </li>
          <li>Throughout the hunt, teams will solve puzzles and perform tasks inspired by the world of “Harry Potter” to collect clues and advance to the next stage.  </li>
          <li>This fast-paced challenge is designed to assess agility, quick thinking, and teamwork.  </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Qualification Criteria: </h3>
      <ul><li>Only 4 teams(one from each house) will qualify for Round 2. The selection criteria will be communicated to all participants before the hunt begins.</li></ul>

      <h2>Round 2: The Triwizard Cup</h2>
      <ul><li>This round is being conducted as confidential and will only be revealed upon the completion of Round 1. The team that emerges victorious in this round will be crowned the overall champions of the scavenger hunt."</li></ul>

      <h2>Rulebook:</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>The organizing committee reserves the sole and absolute right to update, introduce, or remove any existing rules as deemed necessary.</li>
          <li>The Death Eaters will serve as the official enforcers and prosecutors for this event.</li>
          <li>Teams are strictly prohibited from collaborating with other teams to decode puzzles or share hints.</li>
          <li>Additionally, teams must not tamper with or interfere with the puzzles, hints, or progress of other participating teams. Any team found violating these rules will face immediate elimination from the treasure hunt.</li>
          <li>The PR & Media Committee of NST ADYPU, along with the Death Eaters, retains the authority to disqualify any team at any stage of the event for violations of the rules or misconduct.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Guideline:-</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
          Each team will comprise four members, including a designated TECH Person who will remain stationed at the venue throughout the event. The TECH Person will be solely responsible for solving all the coding challenges. Meanwhile, the other three team members will focus on deciphering clues and exploring the designated locations based on the hints provided.
      </li>
      <li>
          The coding questions will be accessible on our coding platform, and only a single device—specifically the TECH Person's device—will be permitted to log in. The TECH Person's activity will be monitored through screen sharing and front camera surveillance. The coding problems will be encrypted with a passkey, which can only be obtained by deciphering the hints discovered by the team members at various locations.
      </li>
      <li>
          Team members are allowed to communicate with each other using their personal mobile phones.
      </li>
