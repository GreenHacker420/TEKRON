        <h1>Rule Book</h1>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No Spying:</strong>Players are not allowed to follow others around or look at their task sheets while not completing their own tasks. This ensures fair play and maintains the challenge for everyone.</li>

          <li><strong>No Cheating:</strong>Players should not share their role (Crewmate, Impostor, or Jester) with others. Revealing your role intentionally or unintentionally will result in disqualification for that round.</li>

          <li><strong>Report the Body:</strong>If you find a dead body, you must report it using the walkie-talkie. You are not allowed to move or hide the body before reporting.</li>

          <li><strong>Task Completion Integrity:</strong>Crewmates must physically go to the designated venues to complete their tasks. No shortcuts, and tasks cannot be skipped.</li>

          <li><strong>Impostor Behavior:</strong>Impostors must act like Crewmates and complete fake tasks. They should not directly confront or attack players unless they are alone. They must "eliminate" players by tapping their shoulder and whispering “You’ghosted.”</li>

          <li><strong>Jester Strategy:</strong>The Jester’s goal is to manipulate others into voting them out. They should avoid directly accusing others or providing obvious hints about their role.</li>

          <li><strong>Voting Process:</strong>Players can only vote once per Emergency Meeting. Players should be mindful of their votes, as strategic voting or voting out the wrong player can affect the game outcome.</li>

          <li><strong>No Rejoining After Elimination:</strong>Once a player is eliminated (either through voting or being "ghosted"), they are not allowed to rejoin the game or interfere with ongoing gameplay.</li>

          <li><strong>Role-Specific Actions:</strong>Players must respect the limitations and abilities of their assigned roles:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Crewmates </strong>Crewmates can only complete tasks and report bodies.</li>
            <li><strong>Impostors</strong> can eliminate players but must blend in with Crewmates to avoid detection.</li>
            <li><strong>Jesters</strong> can’t directly influence the outcome, but their goal is to manipulate others into voting them out.</li>
          </ul></li>

          <li><strong>Behavioral Conduct:</strong>Players should maintain respectful behavior toward one another. Harassment, excessive arguing, or disruptive behavior will lead to disqualification.</li>
          <li><strong>Time Extensions:</strong>If the host determines the game is nearing its conclusion (with few Crewmates remaining or most tasks completed), the host may call for an emergency extension (max 5 minutes) to give players a chance to wrap up.</li>
          <li><strong>Emergency Meetings:</strong>If a player feels suspicious about another’s actions, they can call an Emergency Meeting. Players are only allowed to do this once per round, so use it wisely.</li>
          <li><strong>No External Assistance:</strong>Players should not seek outside help during the game. No external players or bystanders should be involved in the gameplay.</li>
